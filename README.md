# NmeWebApplication-Project
**School of Computer Science (BSc) - City University of London 2017-2018**

This is a web application that represents a simplified version of the "New Musical Express" magazine which is a British music album website. The project was created using NetBeans IDE (Java programming language) including a SQLite database (called "nme") and it has been deployed on a Glassfish application server.

My application fulfils the following use cases:

1. The user is able to display all the albums (album id, album name, release date and artist name) in the database in a table format.
2. The user is able to display a count of the number of artists held in the database.
3. The user is able to provide an album id and display all the tracks on that album.
4. The user is to add an artist to the database.
5. The user is able to remove an album from the database by providing the album id.
